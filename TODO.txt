bugs
- misses data sometimes when m_wnd->addToTab is done
  sometimes data is thrown away around mainwindow.cpp#1477. Not sure why..
- need to re-add command menu(s?) (QTBUG-31549, QTBUG-34160)
- tests fail (probably due to missing platform stuff??)

misc
- test build on cmake
- add docs on how to package app (make copyq.app) to the readme and hacking files
- everything in mac-platform
    - look at these first:
      https://github.com/petroules/petroules-utilities-qt/blob/master/src/windowmanager_mac.mm
      https://github.com/TermiT/Flycut/
    - then these:
      https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst/blob/master/Amethyst/AMWindowManager.m
      https://github.com/jigish/slate/blob/master/Slate/RunningApplications.mm
      https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle

macplatform:
- Figure out a way to raise other apps
- Make sure using objective-c++ code isn't leaking memory
- Find a way to get the current window title instead of the application title
